Welcome to Transpack's documentation!
=====================================

Transpack is a file packing and S3 upload app for managing downloaded 
`transmission <https://transmissionbt.com/>`_ files. It allows a user to 
split and compress (leveraging the systems rar binary) all contents in 
the downloads/ folder for transmission and then upload these rar files 
to an `AWS S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ bucket.
